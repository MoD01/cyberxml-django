An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a single DHCP packet to or through an affected device, causing the device to reload.




Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is available. This advisory is available at the following link:

It is possible to mitigate the vulnerability in this advisory by applying the global configuration command device-sensor filter-spec dhcp exclude all. This command will filter the Device Sensor feature collection of DHCP packets, and the Device Sensor feature will no longer process or store DHCP information.  



In the following example, the global configuration command is issued:




Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# device-sensor filter-spec dhcp exclude all




To confirm that the Device Sensor feature is no longer collecting DHCP data, issue the show device-sensor cache all command. No DHCP entries should be present in the table.  



In the following example, the following table contains only Cisco Discover Protocol data:




Switch# show device-sensor cache all
Device: 000f.f7a7.234f on port GigabitEthernet2/1
