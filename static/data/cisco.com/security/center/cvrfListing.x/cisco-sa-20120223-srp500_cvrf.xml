    Cisco SRP 500 Series Web Interface Command Injection Vulnerability 
    Cisco SRP 500 Series Unauthenticated Configuration Upload Vulnerability 
    Cisco SRP 500 Series Directory Traversal Vulnerability 

These vulnerabilities can be exploited using sessions to the Services Ready Platform Configuration Utility web interface. These vulnerabilities could be exploited from the local LAN side of the SRP device by default configuration and the WAN side of the SRP device if remote management is enabled.  Remote management is disabled by default.



Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. 



Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either enticing an administrator to access a crafted link or
by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept an authenticated
session.  An exploit could allow the attacker to execute operating system commands on the device that are run in the
context of the root user.

The following mitigations help limit exposure to this vulnerability:


    Disable Remote Management

    

    Caution: Do not disable remote management if administrators manage devices using the WAN connection. This action will result in a loss of management connectivity to the device.

    

    Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can disable this feature by choosing Administration &gt; Web Access Management. Change the setting for the Remote Management field to Disabled. 

Disabling remote management limits exposure because the vulnerability can then be exploited from the inter-LAN network only. 

    Limit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses

    

    If remote management is required, secure the device so that it can be accessed by certain IP addresses only, rather than the default setting of All IP Addresses. After choosing Administration &gt; Web Access Management, an administrator can change the Allowed Remote IP Address setting to ensure that only devices with specified IP addresses can access the device.
