    Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing SQL Injection Vulnerability
    Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Buffer Overrun Vulnerability



Exploitation of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing SQL Injection Vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send Structured Query Language (SQL) commands to manipulate the MeetingPlace database stores information about server
configuration, meetings, and users. These commands may be used to create,
delete, or alter some of the information in the Cisco Unified
MeetingPlace Web Conferencing database.



Exploitation of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Buffer Overrun Vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a buffer overrun condition that may cause the Web Conferencing server to become unresponsive.



Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.

This data may include server configurations, meetings, and users. 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of some of the parameters passed through the HTTP POST method. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious SQL commands in the HTTP POST request directed to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete data from the Web Conferencing database.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2012-0337</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-186559</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186561</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186563</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186567</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186568</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186569</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186570</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186571</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186572</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186573</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186574</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186577</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186578</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186579</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186596</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-186598</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing SQL Injection Vulnerability may result in a
