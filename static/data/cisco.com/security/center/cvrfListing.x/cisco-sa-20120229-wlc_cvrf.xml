Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers HTTP Denial of Service Vulnerability

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers IPv6 Denial of Service Vulnerability

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers WebAuth Denial of Service Vulnerability

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Unauthorized Access Vulnerability

CPU based ACLs can be configured to block access to the affected WLC on TCP port 1023. After ACLs are defined, they can be applied to the management interface,
the access point manager (AP-manager) interface, or any of the dynamic
interfaces for client data traffic or to the Network Processing Unit (NPU)
interface for traffic to the controller CPU.
