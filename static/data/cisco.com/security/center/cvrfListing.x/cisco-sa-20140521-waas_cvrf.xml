The vulnerability is due to incorrect buffer handling for SharePoint responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious SharePoint application. An exploit could allow the attacker to crash the application optimization handler and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the WAAS appliance.
