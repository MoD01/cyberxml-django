that allow remote, unauthenticated access to any file on the device and one
vulnerability that allows remote, unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges. There are workarounds available to mitigate
these vulnerabilities.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. This advisory is posted at

It is possible to mitigate the administration interface file access
vulnerability (IronPort Bug 65921) by using the IP address restriction feature
of the administration interface to limit access to trusted hosts. Access to the
administration interface is not restricted by default. To configure access
limits, an administrator should navigate to Configuration -&gt; Web
Services -&gt; Admin -&gt; Console Security area in the Cisco IronPort
Encryption Appliance administration interface.

It is possible to workaround the remote code execution vulnerability
(IronPort Bug 65923) by disabling HTTP Invoker in the Cisco IronPort Encryption
Appliance configuration files. To disable the HTTP Invoker, an administrator
must delete several files in the PostX application home directory and remove a
directive from the web server configuration. The following files must be
deleted:


jboss/server/postx/deploy/http-invoker.sar


jboss/server/postx/deploy/jms/jbossmq-httpil.sar

The following directive must be removed from the
jboss/server/postx/conf/jboss-service.xml web server
configuration file.

     
      
After deleting the files and removing the directive from the
configuration file, the PostX application service must be restarted.



Additional details to implement workaround:

     cd /usr/local/postx/server/jboss/server/postx/deploy

     mv jmx-console.war jmx-console-disabled.war

     cd management

     mv web-console.war web-console-disabled.war

within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin
