This issue will manifest itself when administrators perform an in-service software upgrade to Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) from Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.1a) or earlier.



After the software upgrade, a bug in Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) could cause all the virtual Ethernet ports on the Virtual Ethernet Modules (VEM) of the Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switch to stay in No-Policy pass-through mode because a valid VSG license is not actively installed. As a result, the VEMs no longer use a configured Cisco VSG; therefore, the virtual machines (VM) are not firewalled and traffic is not inspected by the VSG.



This software bug is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCud01427 and a software bulletin for Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) is in the process of being published.
