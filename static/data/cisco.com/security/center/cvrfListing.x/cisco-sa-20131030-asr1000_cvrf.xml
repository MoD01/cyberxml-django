    Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IOS XE Software PPTP Traffic Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IOS XE Software TCP Segment Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Cisco IOS XE Software Malformed EoGRE Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.



Successful exploitation of any of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger a reload of the embedded services processors (ESP) card or the route processor (RP) card, causing an interruption of services.

Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.



Note: Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS-XR Software are not affected by these vulnerabilities.




Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:

The vulnerability is due to improper processing of large TCP reassembled packets that are being processed by NAT and ALG features on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a TCP packet that is large after the reassembly to traverse a vulnerable device. Only packets being handled by NAT and ALG features have a potential to cause an affected device to reload.
