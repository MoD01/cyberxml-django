component that is affected by a remote command execution vulnerability identified by Apache with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID CVE-2010-1870.




The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization on user-supplied input in the XWorks component of the affected software. The component uses the ParameterInterceptors directive to parse the Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions that are implemented via a whitelist feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests
that contain OGNL expressions to an affected system. An
exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system. 



Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability
for all the affected products except Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series. Customers using Cisco
Business Edition 3000 Series should contact their Cisco representative for
available options.



Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.

This vulnerability has been confirmed to allow remote code execution with the privileges of the Administrator user
for Cisco Unified CCE. Exploitation on Cisco ISE, Cisco MXE 3500, and Cisco
Business Edition 3000 Series is theoretically possible but could not be
reproduced. Cisco recommends that customers affected by this vulnerability
upgrade to a fixed software release version.
