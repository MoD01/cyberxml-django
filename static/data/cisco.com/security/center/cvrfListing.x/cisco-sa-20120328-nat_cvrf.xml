This vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling NAT SIP
ALG over the UDP transport by using the no ip nat service sip udp port
5060 global configuration command. This command can only be configured in Cisco IOS images that include the NAT ALG SIP feature. Layer 3 NAT translation will continue to be performed on SIP packets but the SIP payload will not be translated.
