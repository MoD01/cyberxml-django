Manager (CM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the affected system.



The vulnerability is due
to insufficient input validation. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the
affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the
affected system. Due to the privileged function of the WAAS CM
in the Cisco WAAS network, exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker
to gain administrative access to all the devices that have been
associated to the vulnerable WAAS CM.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-3443</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-96260</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-96261</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114279</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114281</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114282</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114283</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114284</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114285</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-184112</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-184113</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192291</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192293</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192294</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192295</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192296</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192297</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192298</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192299</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192300</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192301</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192302</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-192303</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may cause an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary command and completely compromise the affected system.
