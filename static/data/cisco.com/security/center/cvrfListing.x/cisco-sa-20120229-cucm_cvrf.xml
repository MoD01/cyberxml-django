Cisco Unified Communications Manager devices may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to send crafted Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) messages to an affected device to cause a reload or execute attacker-controlled SQL code. 

Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities. 


Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.
