The vulnerability exists because JBoss Application Server Remote Method Invocation (RMI) services, specifically the jboss.system:service=MainDeployer functionality, are exposed to unauthorized users. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending arbitrary commands via RMI services. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2012-5417</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-185361</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185363</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185365</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185367</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185369</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185370</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185371</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185372</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185373</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185374</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185375</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185376</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185377</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185378</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185379</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185380</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-185381</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-191944</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-191945</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system that hosts the Cisco Prime DCNM application in the context of the System user for Cisco Prime DCNM running on Microsoft Windows, or the root user for Cisco Prime DCNM running on Linux.</Description></Threat></Threats><CVSSScoreSets><ScoreSet><BaseScore>10.0</BaseScore><TemporalScore>8.3</TemporalScore><Vector>AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/</Vector></ScoreSet></CVSSScoreSets><Remediations><Remediation Type="Workaround"><Description>Because RMI transactions start with a connection to the RMI registry port, which by default is TCP port 1099 or 9099 depending on the Cisco Prime DCNM version, allowing only legitimate devices to connect to the RMI registry port can mitigate this vulnerability.
