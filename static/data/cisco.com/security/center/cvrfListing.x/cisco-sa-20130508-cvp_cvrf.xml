CSCub38384["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38384"] (registered["http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do"] customers only).




To implement the
workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability, the Manager and Host-Manager web applications must be removed manually from the Tomcat instances on CVP servers. Follow the instructions to remove the Manager and Host-Manager web applications:




Stop the services of respective server:

The ?manager? and ?host-manager? web applications need to be manually removed from Tomcat instances of your CVP servers.


CVP VXML Server

Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Call
Server

Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Operation
Console Server

Go to the
C:\Cisco\CVP\OPSConsoleServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete
the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Reporting Server

Go
to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete
the Manager and Host-Manager folders.


A workaround is available for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCub38379["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38379"] (registered["http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do"] customers only).



To implement the
workaround for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance, follow these steps:



Stop the service of VXML Server:



Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\conf folder and edit server.xml file.



Modify autoDeploy to false. Earlier it was true.




None of the other vulnerabilities published in this document have workarounds.

A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal
Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCub38384["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38384"] (registered["http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do"] customers only).




To implement the
workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability, the Manager and Host-Manager web applications must be removed manually from the Tomcat instances on CVP servers. Follow the instructions to remove the Manager and Host-Manager web applications:




Stop the services of respective server:

The ?manager? and ?host-manager? web applications need to be manually removed from Tomcat instances of your CVP servers.


CVP VXML Server

Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Call
Server

Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Operation
Console Server

Go to the
C:\Cisco\CVP\OPSConsoleServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete
the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Reporting Server

Go
to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete
the Manager and Host-Manager folders.


A workaround is available for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCub38379["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38379"] (registered["http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do"] customers only).



To implement the
workaround for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance, follow these steps:



Stop the service of VXML Server:



Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\conf folder and edit server.xml file.



Modify autoDeploy to false. Earlier it was true.




None of the other vulnerabilities published in this document have workarounds.
