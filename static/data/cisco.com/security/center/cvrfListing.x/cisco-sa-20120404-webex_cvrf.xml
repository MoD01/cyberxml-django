In some cases, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of a targeted user.



The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The players can also be manually installed for offline playback after downloading the application from www.webex.com["http://www.webex.com/"].



If the WRF player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the WRF player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from www.webex.com["http://www.webex.com/"].



Cisco has updated affected versions of the WebEx meeting sites and WRF player to address these vulnerabilities.
